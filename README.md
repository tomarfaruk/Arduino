My Arduino web app link here  https://arduino-f7537.firebaseapp.com
don't be afraid to see 200 lines of code it's very easy, same code you have to write for control all the devices.
1. firstly we to have to install some library for elsp8266 and firebase
2. go to this link and download it,    https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firebase-arduino
3. than go to your Arduino Ide and click the Sketch function you find it beside Tools, then select your zip file it will take some while for installing 
4.  go to this link and download it, https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino than follow the step 3 instruction 
5. after this you need to go to Tools and click Manage Library than Search for ArduinoJson and install 5.13.2 don't install the latest version
it may create some error while you run your code
